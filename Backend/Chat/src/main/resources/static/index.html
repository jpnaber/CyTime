    * This is our CyTime app. It is a community based app that allows everyone to see everyone's <br>
    * to do list items, to add, edit, or delete the user's own to do list items, and to chat <br>
    * with registered user in the community. <br>
</p>
<p>
    * Upon opening of the app, the user can choose either <br>
    * to enter as a logged in user though login function on the main screen, or user can choose <br>
    * to enter in the multi-user mode. In multi-user mode, the user can see everyone's task, but <br>
    * does not have edit or delete privileges. Upon logged in, the user can edit or delete the <br>
    * task that belongs to the user, and to chat with other registered users in the chat room. <br>
</p>
<p>
    * The chat room broadcasts a message when anyone enters or exits the room. The chat room also <br>
    * has a button that takes the user to My Friends page where the entire friends list (registered <br>
    * users), along with their status are displayed. If a friend is currently active in the chat <br>
    * room, then the [HI] button on the right side of that friend card will turn green. If the friend <br>
    * is not online then the icon turns green and will display [N/A]. <br> <br>
